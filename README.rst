(Looking for a **Python 3** compatible jpype? `See tcalmant's fork <https://github.com/tcalmant/jpype-py3>`__)

From the `original Website <http://jpype.sourceforge.net/index.html>`__:

    JPype is an effort to allow python programs full access to java
    class libraries. This is achieved not through re-implementing
    Python, as Jython/JPython has done, but rather through interfacing
    at the native level in both Virtual Machines. Eventually, it should
    be possible to replace Java with python in many, though not all,
    situations. JSP, Servlets, RMI servers and IDE plugins are good
    candidates.

    Once this integration is achieved, a second phase will be started to
    separate the Java logic from the Python logic, eventually allowing
    the bridging technology to be used in other environments, I.E. Ruby,
    Perl, COM, etc ...

This friendly fork applies changes to make the installation easier on OSX
and Linux, as suggested by `Yuvul
Adam <http://blog.y3xz.com/post/5037243230/installing-jpype-on-mac-os-x>`__
, the beautiful people in `one of the JPype Stackoverflow
postings <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8525193/cannot-install-jpype-on-os-x-lion-to-use-with-neo4j>`__
and all the other `CONTRIBUTORS <https://github.com/originell/jpype/blob/master/AUTHORS>`__.

The `changelog can be found on github <https://github.com/originell/jpype/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`__.

Known Bugs/Limitations
----------------------

-  Java classes outside of a package (in the ``<default>``) cannot be
   imported.
-  unable to access a field or method if it conflicts with a python
   keyword.
-  Because of lack of JVM support, you cannot shutdown the JVM and then
   restart it.
-  Some methods rely on the "current" class/caller. Since calls coming
   directly from python code do not have a current class, these methods
   do not work. The User Manual lists all the known methods like that.

Requirements
------------

Either the Sun/Oracle JDK/JRE Variant or OpenJDK.

Debian/Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian/Ubuntu users will have to install ``g++`` and ``python-dev``
first:

::

    sudo apt-get install g++ python-dev

Installation
------------

Should be easy as

::

    python setup.py install


If it fails...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This happens mostly due to the setup not being able to find your
``JAVA_HOME``. In case this happens, please do two things:

1. You can continue the installation by finding the ``JAVA_HOME`` on
   your own ( the place where the headers etc. are) and explicitly
   setting it for the installation:

   JAVA\_HOME=/usr/lib/java/jdk1.6.0/ python setup.py install
2. Please create an Issue `on
   github <https://github.com/originell/jpype/issues?state=open>`__ and
   post all the information you have.

Tested on
---------

-  OS X 10.7.4 with Sun/Oracle JDK 1.6.0
-  OSX 10.8.1-10.8.4 with Sun/Oracle JDK 1.6.0
-  OSX 10.9 DP5
-  Debian 6.0.4/6.0.5 with Sun/Oracle JDK 1.6.0
-  Debian 7.1 with OpenJDK 1.6.0
-  Ubuntu 12.04 with Sun/Oracle JDK 1.6.0
