JVM startup debugging
=====================

So the JVM won't start under JPype.  It works fine for everyone else, but just
not you.  Now what?  The following instructions are for Linux, but apply to 
most unix like systems with minor modifications.

JAVA_HOME
---------

First make sure your JAVA_HOME is set correctly.  It should point to a
directory containing the JRE or JDK.  It should look something like...::

  bin conf COPYRIGHT include jmods legal lib release

For Unix we expect to find ``$JAVA_HOME\lib\server\libjvm.so`` or
``$JAVA_HOME\lib\client\libjvm.dll``.  We will assume it is server for this
document.


Architecture
------------

To check the type of a file, use the ``file`` command.

First lets check the architecture of the ``libjvm.so`` file::

    $ file $JAVA_HOME/lib/server/libjvm.so
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/lib/server/libjvm.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, 
       version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked, BuildID[sha1]=1313ccf3deaef446a6c2fec9561f2232e4202bc8, stripped

We can also check the architecture of python or the test file::

    $ file a.out
    a.out: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/l, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=24c58f45e6aa4a41c0d69a74063243b692d51e0d, not stripped

    $ file /usr/bin/python3.8
    /usr/bin/python3.8: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/l, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=f9e05e26d8232239158889727d8056c122a9e958, stripped

The import thing is that each must have the samme architecture.  In this case, 64-bit LSB x86-64.

If one or more libraries or binaries has a mismatch then it likely won't work with that JVM.


Dependencies
------------

The JVM has many dependencies.  If any of them are missing, or
not in a search path, or they are the wrong architecture then 
it will fail to load.  To get a list of dependencies use::

    ldd -v "$JAVA_HOME/lib/server/libjvm.so"

It should produce an output similar to::

        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffff3591000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fd55b5b0000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fd55b390000)
        libstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007fd55b000000)
        libm.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6 (0x00007fd55ac60000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fd55a860000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fd55cc00000)
        libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fd55a640000)

If any of these libraries are missing or the wrong architecture it will cause issues.

Testing the JVM
---------------

Assuming that you have the JAVA_HOME set, the architectures are correct, and 
all of the dependencies are in place it should load.  But lets run a test.

Compile using the System C++ compiler.

Use::

   g++ testJVM.cpp -ldl

Run it with::

   a.out "$JAVA_HOME\lib\server\libjvm.so"

It should produce and output like::

    $ ./a.out  $JAVA_HOME/lib/server/libjvm.so
    Load library
    Load entry points
      Entry point found 0x7fad8e08f670
    Pack JVM arguments
      Num options: 0
    Create JVM
    Create Java resources
    Destroy JVM
    Unload library
    Success

Testing static load
-------------------

Dlopen provides very little diagnostic information.  So you may want to try a static JVM load.

To build a static JVM test use::

        g++ staticJVM.cpp -ljvm -L $JAVA_HOME/lib/server/

The launch it with::

        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/server a.out

This should produce the output::

    Pack JVM arguments
      Num options: 0
      Create JVM
      Create Java resources
      Destroy JVM
      Success

If the library does not match it should produce something like::

    ./a.out: error while loading shared libraries: libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
