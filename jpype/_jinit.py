    This can be used to load module resources that depend on the JVM such as loading
    classes.  If the JVM is not started, the user supplied function is held in a list until
    the JVM starts.  When startJVM is called, all functions on the deferred list are called
    and the list is cleared.  If the JVM is already started, then the function is called
    immediately.

    Errors from the function will either be raised immediately if the JVM is started, or 
    from startJVM if the JVM is not yet started.

       func (callable): a function to call when the JVM is started.
