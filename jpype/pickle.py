JPype Pickle Module
--------------------

This module contains overloaded Pickler and Unpickler classes that operate
on Java classes. Pickling of Java objects is restricted to classes
that implement Serializable.  Mixed pickles files containing both
Java and Python objects are allowed.  Only one copy of each Java object
will appear in the pickle file even it is appears multiple times in the
data structure.

JPicklers and JUnpickler use Java ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream
to serial objects. All of the usual java serialization errors may be
thrown.

For Python 3 series, this is backed by the native cPickler implementation.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

  myobj = jpype.JClass('java.util.ArrayList')
  myobj.add("test")

  from jpype.pickle import JPickler, JUnpickler
  with open("test.pic", "wb") as fd:
    JPickler(fd).dump(myobj)

  with open("test.pic", "rb") as fd:
    newobj = JUnpickler.load(fd)


Proxies and other JPype specific module resources cannot be pickled currently.

Requires:
    Python 2.7 or 3.6 or later
