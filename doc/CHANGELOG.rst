Changelog
=========

This changelog *only* contains changes from the *first* pypi release (0.5.4.3) onwards.

- **Next version - unreleased**
  - Added extra verbiage to the to the raised exception when an overloaded
    method could not be matched.  It now prints a list of all possible method
    signatures.
  - Harded code to unattached threads and accessing java objects after shutdown.
  - The following is now DEPRECATED
    - jpype.reflect.* - All class information is available with .class_
    - Python thread option for JPypeReferenceQueue.  References are always handled with
      with the Java cleanup routine.  The undocumented setUsePythonThreadForDaemon()
      will be removed at a future version.
  - promoted --install-option to a --global-option as it applies to the build as well
    as install.

- **0.6.3 - 2018-04-03**
  - Java reference counting has been converted to use JNI
    PushLocalFrame/PopLocalFrame.  Several resource leaks
    were removed.

  - java.lang.Class<>.forName() will now return the java.lang.Class.
    Work arounds for requiring the class loader are no longer needed.
    Customizers now support customization of static members.

  - Support of java.lang.Class<>
    - java.lang.Object().getClass() on Java objects returns a java.lang.Class
      rather than the Python class
    - java.lang.Object().__class__ on Java objects returns the python class
      as do all python objects
    - java.lang.Object.class_ maps to the java statement 'java.lang.Object.class' and
      returns the java.lang.Class<java.lang.Object>
    - java.lang.Class supports reflection methods
    - private fields and methods can be accessed via reflection
    - annotations are avaiable via reflection

  - Java objects and arrays will not accept setattr unless the
    attribute corresponds to a java method or field whith
    the exception of private attributes that begin with
    underscore.

  - Added support for automatic conversion of boxed types.
     - Boxed types automatically convert to python primitives.
     - Boxed types automatically convert to java primitives when resolving functions.
     - Functions taking boxed or primitives still resolve based on closest match.

  - Python integer primitives will implicitly match java float and double as per
    Java specification.

  - Added support for try with resources for java.lang.Closeable.
    Use python "with MyJavaResource() as resource:" statement
    to automatically close a resource at the end of a block.

- **0.6.2 - 2017-01-13**

  - Fix JVM location for OSX.
  - Fix a method overload bug.
  - Add support for synthetic methods

- **0.6.1 - 2015-08-05**

  - Fix proxy with arguments issue.
  - Fix Python 3 support for Windows failing to import winreg.
  - Fix non matching overloads on iterating java collections.

- **0.6.0 - 2015-04-13**

  - Python3 support.
  - Fix OutOfMemoryError.

- **0.5.7 - 2014-10-29**

  - No JDK/JRE is required to build anymore due to provided jni.h. To
    override this, one needs to set a JAVA_HOME pointing to a JDK
    during setup.
  - Better support for various platforms and compilers (MinGW, Cygwin,
    Windows)

- **0.5.6 - 2014-09-27**

  - *Note*: In this release we returned to the three point number
    versioning scheme.
  - Fix #63: 'property' object has no attribute 'isBeanMutator'
  - Fix #70: python setup.py develop does now work as expected
  - Fix #79, Fix #85: missing declaration of 'uint'
  - Fix #80: opt out NumPy code dependency by '--disable-numpy'
    parameter to setup.  To opt out with pip
    append --install-option="--disable-numpy".
  - Use JVMFinder method of @tcalmant to locate a Java runtime

- **0.5.5.4 - 2014-08-12**

  - Fix: compile issue, if numpy is not available (NPY_BOOL
    n/a). Closes #77

- **0.5.5.3 - 2014-08-11**

  - Optional support for NumPy arrays in handling of Java arrays. Both
    set and get slice operators are supported. Speed improvement of
    factor 10 for setting and factor 6 for getting. The returned
    arrays are typed with the matching NumPy type.
  - Fix: add missing wrapper type 'JShort'
  - Fix: Conversion check for unsigned types did not work in array
    setters (tautological compare)

- **0.5.5.2 - 2014-04-29**

  - Fix: array setter memory leak (ISSUE: #64)

- **0.5.5.1 - 2014-04-11**

  - Fix: setup.py now runs under MacOSX with Python 2.6 (referred to
    missing subprocess function)

- **0.5.5 - 2014-04-11**

  - *Note* that this release is *not* compatible with Python 2.5 anymore!
  - Added AHL changes

    * replaced Python set type usage with new 2.6.x and higher
    * fixed broken Python slicing semantics on JArray objects
    * fixed a memory leak in the JVM when passing Python lists to
      JArray constructors
    * prevent ctrl+c seg faulting
    * corrected new[]/delete pairs to stop valgrind complaining
    * ship basic PyMemoryView implementation (based on numpy's) for Python 2.6 compatibility

  - Fast sliced access for primitive datatype arrays (factor of 10)
  - Use setter for Java bean property assignment even if not having a
    getter by @baztian
  - Fix public methods not being accessible if a Java bean property
    with the same name exists by @baztian (*Warning*: In rare cases
    this change is incompatibile to previous releases. If you are
    accessing a bean property without using the get/set method and the
    bean has a public method with the property's name you have to
    change the code to use the get/set methods.)
  - Make jpype.JException catch exceptions from subclasses by @baztian
  - Make more complex overloaded Java methods accessible (fixes
    https://sourceforge.net/p/jpype/bugs/69/) by @baztian and
    anonymous
  - Some minor improvements inferring unnecessary copies in extension
    code
  - Some JNI cleanups related to memory
  - Fix memory leak in array setters
  - Fix memory leak in typemanager
  - Add userguide from sourceforge project by @baztian

- **0.5.4.5 - 2013-08-25**

  - Added support for OSX 10.9 Mavericks by @rmangino (#16)

- **0.5.4.4 - 2013-08-10**

  - Rewritten Java Home directory Search by @marsam (#13, #12 and #7)
  - Stylistic cleanups of setup.py

- **0.5.4.3 - 2013-07-27**

  - Initial pypi release with most fixes for easier installation
