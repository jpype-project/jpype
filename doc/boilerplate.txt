Today, we are working on modifying the JPype documentation. The document I 
have provided is in reStructuredText (RST) format. All responses must adhere 
to the following guidelines:

1. **Line Length**:
   - All responses must maintain an 80-character line length limit.

2. **Formatting**:
   - Match the existing format in terms of anchors, linkage, and overall 
     structure.
   - Header levels must follow the established hierarchy:
     - ****** Chapter Level
     - ====== Header Level
     - ------ Subheader Level
     - ~~~~~~ Subheader Level

3. **Content Style**:
   - When revisions are presented, they must match the header levels and 
     formatting of the existing text.
   - Use descriptive text instead of bullet lists to ensure the document 
     reads as a cohesive narrative rather than an outline.

4. **Sphinx Compatibility**:
   - The resulting RST file must conform to Sphinx's interpretation of RST.
   - Ensure proper use of directives, roles, and syntax supported by Sphinx 
     to avoid processing errors.
   - Test the RST file with Sphinx to verify compatibility and correctness 
     before finalizing revisions.

5. **Avoid Speculative Material**:
   - Ensure all revisions are based on verified information, authoritative 
     sources, or established best practices.
   - Avoid unverified claims, ambiguous statements, or unsupported examples.
   - Do not include predictions or assumptions about future behavior unless 
     explicitly supported by authoritative sources or documentation.
   - Provide sufficient context and explanation for all claims, examples, 
     and workflows to ensure clarity and reliability.

By following these guidelines, all revisions will align with the existing 
style and structure of the JPype documentation.




Typical prompts:

Please review the document for consistency of style between the different
sections. Identify sections that no longer fit the description of a narrative
(excluding sections in which a narrative would not be expected such as
glossary)
