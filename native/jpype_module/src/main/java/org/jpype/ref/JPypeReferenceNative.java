/**
 * Internal class used to manage object lifetimes in the Python-to-Java bridge.
 *
 * The {@code JPypeReferenceNative} class provides native methods to handle
 * memory management and resource cleanup for objects shared between Python and
 * Java. It acts as a bridge to the underlying C++ layer, enabling efficient
 * management of native resources during garbage collection (GC) and object
 * lifecycle events.
 *
 * <p>
 * Key responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Remove references to native resources when they are no longer needed</li>
 * <li>Handle initialization of resources for objects</li>
 * <li>Respond to garbage collection events</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is primarily intended for internal use within the JPype library
 * and should not be used directly by application developers.
