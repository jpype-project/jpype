/**
 * Java front-end interface for the Python `memoryview` type.
 * <p>
 * The {@code PyMemoryView} interface represents a concrete Python `memoryview`
 * object, which provides a way to access the memory of other objects (such as
 * bytes or bytearrays) without copying the data. This enables efficient
 * manipulation of binary data in Python.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code PyMemoryView} interface extends {@link PyObject}, allowing it to
 * behave as a Python object in a Java environment. It provides access to
 * Python's `memoryview` functionality, enabling developers to work with memory
 * buffers directly from Java.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Python's `memoryview` objects support slicing, indexing, and various
 * attributes for inspecting memory buffers. This interface provides methods
 * that align with Python's `memoryview` API to enable efficient manipulation of
 * memory buffers in Java.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * PyMemoryView memoryView = ...; // Obtain a PyMemoryView instance
 * int length = memoryView.getLength(); // Get the size of the memory buffer
 * byte[] slice = memoryView.sublist(0, 10); // Get a slice of the memory buffer
 * </pre>
 * </p>
